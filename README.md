### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a college student learning the basics of Computer Science. 
Currently GitHub serves as the "Hub" for the work of one of my courses.
I am interested in Computer Science to be able to have a general understanding of the field in order to more broadly apply it to other projects.
